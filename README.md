"Back Up"   v1.0

A Roguelike written in 7 days for http://7DRL.org



PLOT
====

After years of dedicated service you have tired of doing the bidding of your
workaholic dungeon boss. You have no more promotion prospects until he dies but
you yearn for the simple life. The simple life of a peasant in the lands far
above in fact. So it is time to bow out and try and get out of here alive.

It should be easy, you are a mighty level 35 'thing'. But there are two
problems to overcome -

* You can't remember the stairways being so narrow when you first came down
  here.
* The humans will never trust such a splendidly dressed fellow living as a
  peasant living in their midst.

The only thing for it is to ditch the epic gear. So level-down along the way
and see if you can make it... Back Up




RUNNING THE GAME
================

Linux   - Unpack the files, make sure Backup.sh is executable and run it. 

Windows - Unpack the files, run Backup.bat

Mac     - Do whatever you do to make java stuff run. Maybe the same as Linux,
          who knows.



HOW TO PLAY
===========

Keys -

WASD or arrow keys to move, Space to pickup or go up/down stairs.
Mouse over gear on the left to see it's stats. Left click to equip or use the
item. Right click to destroy it.

Your equipped items are shown on the bottom left, your inventory above that.
You might even start with some items in there. Your player stats are at the top
left and enemies that can see you will appear below that.



HOW TO WIN
==========
Get all the way to level 1 and out.



TIPS
====
* Keep gear with dodge and armour as long as possible.
* Dump Str and crit as fast as you can without weakening to fast.
* Downgrade as fast as you can, you can't get up stairs if your effective gear 
  level is 5 levels higher than the current floor level.
